# cpsc3200

These are the project files for my Object Oriented Class projects for Fall 2022.  
Projects alternated in languages of C# and C++
Unit testing is utilized thoughout to test the files.

P1 (C#)  
First assignment focuses on modeling a strength training or strength lifting set called a fitset. This encapsulated class has the attributes such as name, classification, weight, target reps, and performed reps. Employs the OOP tenets of abstraction, encapsulation and information hiding.

P2 (C++)  
Second assignment creates another class that stores an array of the fitset class inside of this class. Member functions allow the user to add and remove fitset objects and more.

P3 (C#)  
Third assignment reworks the fitset class and creates a base class design from it, where fitset and 2 other class designs inherit from the base workout class. The sessionlog class is then reworked to store the heterogeneous array of type workout. Utilizes inheritance and dependency inversion.

P4 (C++)
Fourth assignment adds many overloaded operators in C++ to the sessionlog class design. Two operators are implemented as global methods and two operators are members of the sessionlog class. There are also non destructive and destructive operators. These operators are from the different categories out of arithmetic, relational/comparison, logical, indexing, and stream.

P5 (C#)
Fifth assignment demonstrates my knowledge of interfaces and simulated multiple inheritance in C#. These interfaces are used to alert if certain events happen in the code, alerting the subscribed observers to write messages to files or the console.
